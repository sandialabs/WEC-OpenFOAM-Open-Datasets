# WEC OpenFOAM Open Datasets
<div align="justify">
Welcome to the landing page for the OpenFOAM Wave Energy Converter Open Datasets!

<br /> 
This repository is a collection of templates, examples, helper scripts, and data-sets compiled with the goal of improving the accessibility of high-fidelity CFD simulation of WECs using OpenFOAM. 

### Case types


### <tt>template</tt> vs <tt>example</tt>
In this repository, you will encounter two kinds of directories per case type: template, and example. 

A <tt>template</tt> is a baseline case setup (for each case type) that provides a generic guide for how to set up that kind of case. The interested user can make modifications to a given <tt>template</tt> case to adapt it to their own needs. 

The <tt>example</tt> cases provided are all built off the <tt>template</tt> case of the same type, and therefore provide examples for how a given <tt>template</tt> may be modified to produce different results. 

As such, the README files for the <tt>template</tt> directories will provide more basic information about their given case type, while the READMEs for the <tt>example</tt> may provide more information about the specific examples being presented, analysis of those example data sets, etc. 

### Pre-packaged simulation data
In order to provide the user with a way to "check their work" and give a sense of what output data for a certain case should look like, pre-packaged simulation data of some form is often provided with the <tt>example</tt> cases. As the raw output data from OpenFOAM can be quite large, the datasets typically provided are created from post-processing the raw OpenFOAM output in some form. The auxiliary scripts needed to do this post-processing are provided. These are typically a combination of bash and python scripts.

### About OpenFOAM 



### About the Reference Model 6
The Reference Model 6 (RM6) is a Backward Bent Duct Buoy (BBDB), a type of oscillating water column wave energy converter. The BBDB consists of an air chamber, an L-shaped duct, bow and stern buoyancy modules, and a power take-off (PTO) system composed of a Wells air turbine and a generator, as shown in Figure 1. This L-shaped device opens to the ocean downstream from the wave propagation direction. Power is generated by the motion of the wave, which causes variations in the ambient pressure within the air chamber, forcing air to flow through the Wells turbine. Figure 1 illustrates the main components and dimensions of a BBDB.
